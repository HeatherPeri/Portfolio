### Required: Update your Portfolio Site -- Employer Ready

To receive a passing grade on this assignment, you should meet all of the content and design requirements listed below as well as all of the requirements listed under "Polish Your Portfolio & Github" in the "Employer Ready" section of the [Employer Ready vs. Employer Competitive Checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view). These two sets of requirements should be mostly the same.

#### Content


* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the code on GitHub

#### Design

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes


### Suggested: Update Portfolio -- Employer Competitive

To receive an "A" on this assignment, you should also meet the following requirements
to ensure your portfolio site will help you be [employer competitive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Competitive Content

* At least 3 deployed projects

* External content:

  * Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far

  * Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
  how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach

  * Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable

#### Competitive Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:


* Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
